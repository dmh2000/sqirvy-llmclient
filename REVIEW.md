# Code Review

## Bugs

1. `pkg/sqirvy/client.go`: 
   - Line 38: No explicit handling of context timeout in `queryTextLangChain()`. While a context is passed, there's no explicit check for context cancellation before processing.

2. `cmd/sqirvy-cli/cmd/prompts.go`:
   - Line ~100-150: The SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) mitigation in URL parsing is basic and might not catch all potential security risks.

## Security

1. `pkg/sqirvy/anthropic.go` and `pkg/sqirvy/openai.go`:
   - API key validation is minimal. While basic length checks are performed, more robust validation could be implemented.

2. `cmd/sqirvy-cli/cmd/prompts.go`:
   - URL scraping and file reading lack comprehensive input sanitization.
   - Potential SSRF vulnerability in URL resolution and scraping.

3. Environment Variable Security:
   - Sensitive API keys are read directly from environment variables without additional encryption or secure storage mechanisms.

## Performance

1. `pkg/util/files.go`:
   - `ReadFile()` reads entire files into memory, which could be inefficient for very large files.
   - No streaming or chunked reading implemented.

2. `pkg/sqirvy/client.go`:
   - `queryTextLangChain()` builds a complete response in memory using `strings.Builder`, which might be inefficient for very large responses.

3. `cmd/sqirvy-cli/cmd/prompts.go`:
   - Input processing involves multiple string concatenations and conversions, which can be memory-intensive.

## Style and Idiomatic Code

1. Consistent use of error handling and wrapping.
2. Good separation of concerns across packages.
3. Comprehensive use of interfaces and abstraction.
4. Extensive use of context for timeout and cancellation.

Minor style observations:
- Some functions could benefit from more granular error handling.
- Some comments could be more descriptive about potential edge cases.

## Recommendations

1. Security Enhancements:
   - Implement more robust API key validation
   - Add additional SSRF protections
   - Consider using a secrets management solution
   - Add input sanitization for file and URL inputs

2. Performance Improvements:
   - Implement streaming file reading
   - Add optional chunking for large inputs
   - Consider using `io.Writer` for more efficient response handling

3. Error Handling:
   - Add more specific error types
   - Improve error context in complex functions
   - Implement more granular error logging

4. Code Quality:
   - Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Implement more detailed input validation
   - Consider adding more configuration options

## Summary

The codebase is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns and a consistent architectural approach. It provides a flexible interface for interacting with multiple AI language models. The primary areas for improvement are in security hardening, performance optimization, and more comprehensive error handling.

Key strengths include:
- Modular design
- Support for multiple AI providers
- Flexible command-line interface
- Comprehensive input processing

Key areas for future enhancement:
- Security improvements
- Performance optimizations
- More robust error handling
