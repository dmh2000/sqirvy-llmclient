## Overview

The `cmd/sqirvy-cli/cmd` package implements a command-line interface for interacting with various Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides different commands for specific tasks such as querying an LLM, generating plans, generating code, and reviewing code. The application is built on the Cobra framework and uses Viper for configuration management.

## File-by-File Review

### code.go

**Bugs:**
- Typo in the Long description: "sqiryv-cli" instead of "sqirvy-cli"

**Improvements:**
- Consider adding command-specific flags for code generation (e.g., language preference, code style)
- Add examples in the usage documentation
- Consider implementing a way to save generated code directly to a file

### execute.go

**Bugs:**
- Error formatting issue: `return "", fmt.Errorf("error: reading prompt:[]string{\n%v", err)` - The error message appears malformed

**Improvements:**
- Add context timeout management rather than using `context.Background()` without a timeout
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- Add handling for context cancellation
- Consider adding more detailed error information in error returns
- Add telemetry or logging options for tracking usage and debugging

### models.go

**Improvements:**
- Add error handling if `GetModelProviderList()` returns an error or empty list
- Display additional information about models (e.g., capabilities, token limits, pricing tier)
- Add filtering options (e.g., by provider, capability, or token limit)
- Consider adding a `--verbose` flag to show more details about each model

### plan.go

**Bugs:**
- Typo in the Long description: "sqiryv-cli" instead of "sqirvy-cli"

**Improvements:**
- Consider adding command-specific flags for plan generation (e.g., level of detail, focus area)
- Add examples in the usage documentation

### prompts.go

**Bugs:**
- Inconsistent error handling patterns - sometimes returns `[]string{""}`, sometimes `nil`

**Improvements:**
- Consider more efficient handling of large inputs - currently checking total size after each addition
- Add validation for embedded prompt files existence at startup
- Make the marker format configurable
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed URLs or files
- Add support for additional input formats (e.g., JSON, YAML)

### query.go

**Improvements:**
- Consider adding a `--raw` flag to skip the system prompt for truly arbitrary queries
- Add examples in the usage documentation

### review.go

**Bugs:**
- Typo in the Long description: "sqiryv-cli" instead of "sqirvy-cli"

**Improvements:**
- Consider adding command-specific flags for review (e.g., focus on security, performance, style)
- Add examples in the usage documentation
- Consider implementing a way to save reviews directly to a file or integrate with code review tools

### root.go

**Bugs:**
- `cfgFile` variable is declared but never set (the flag for it is commented out)

**Improvements:**
- Add validation for temperature being within 0.0-1.0 range
- Uncomment and implement the config file flag or remove the unused variable
- Consider adding a version flag or command
- Add a more detailed help command with examples
- Consider adding shell completion command generation

### types.go

**Improvements:**
- Extend with more types and constants for better code organization
- Add custom types for command parameters
- Consider adding structured error types for better error handling
- Add configuration types to better organize configuration parameters

## General Observations

**Strengths:**
- Consistent command structure and implementation patterns
- Good use of documentation comments
- Good separation of concerns between files
- Proper use of Cobra and Viper for CLI and configuration management
- Excellent security practices with SSRF protection for URL handling

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Several typos in command descriptions ("sqiryv-cli" instead of "sqirvy-cli")
- Repetitive command structure could be abstracted further to reduce code duplication
- No automated tests included in the reviewed files
- No version flag or command
- No explicit help command (though Cobra provides this by default)
- No command for generating shell completion scripts
- Limited error handling in some areas

## Recommendations

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Fix typos in documentation strings
   - Standardize error handling patterns across all files
   - Consider implementing a common base command structure to reduce repetition

2. **Functionality:**
   - Add command-specific flags for more customized behavior
   - Implement timeout and cancellation handling for API requests
   - Add a version command
   - Add examples to usage documentation
   - Consider adding output formatting options (e.g., JSON, markdown)

3. **Testing and Maintenance:**
   - Implement automated tests for all commands
   - Add a changelog to track changes
   - Consider implementing telemetry for usage tracking and debugging
   - Add shell completion generation

4. **User Experience:**
   - Add more examples in documentation
   - Consider adding a progress indicator for long-running operations
   - Implement output coloring for better readability
   - Consider adding an interactive mode for complex queries

By addressing these issues and implementing the suggested improvements, the sqirvy-cli tool could become more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
