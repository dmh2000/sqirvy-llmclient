# Review of `pkg/sqirvy/gemini.go`

This document reviews the implementation of the Gemini client in the sqirvy CLI tool, identifying potential bugs and areas for improvement.

## Overview

The `gemini.go` file implements a client for Google's Gemini AI models using the langchaingo library. It provides functionality for making text queries to Gemini models with configurable parameters.

## Issues and Implementation Status

### 1. ✅ Package Documentation Inconsistency (FIXED)

**Issue:** The file started with a package comment referring to "Package api" but the actual package name is "sqirvy".

**Resolution:** The package comment has been updated to be consistent with the actual package name:

```go
// Package sqirvy provides integration with Google's Gemini AI models.
package sqirvy
```

### 2. ✅ Error Handling in QueryText Method (FIXED)

**Issue:** The `QueryText` method directly accessed `modelToMaxTokens[model]` without checking if the model exists in the map. This could cause issues if an invalid model is provided.

**Resolution:** The code now uses the `GetMaxTokens` function to safely retrieve max tokens:

```go
options.MaxTokens = GetMaxTokens(model)
```

### 3. ✅ Limited Timeout Handling (DOCUMENTED)

**Issue:** The client doesn't implement explicit timeout handling beyond what's provided by the context.

**Resolution:** The reliance on context for timeout handling is now documented:

```go
// Request timeouts are handled by the input context
```

### 4. ✅ Lack of Model Validation (FIXED)

**Issue:** The client accepts any model string without validating if it's a supported Gemini model.

**Resolution:** Model validation has been added to prevent invalid API requests:

```go
provider, err := GetProviderName(model)
if err != nil || provider != Gemini {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid or unsupported Gemini model: %s", model)
}
```

### 5. ✅ Error Handling for API Key (FIXED)

**Issue:** While the code checks if the API key environment variable is set, it doesn't validate that the key is in the correct format or test its validity.

**Resolution:** More robust API key validation has been added:

```go
apiKey := os.Getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
if apiKey == "" {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set")
}
if len(apiKey) < 20 {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid GEMINI_API_KEY: key appears to be too short")
}
```

### 6. ❌ Lack of Endpoint Customization (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Issue:** Unlike some other clients, the Gemini client doesn't provide an option to customize the API endpoint. This limits flexibility in testing or using alternative endpoints.

**Recommendation:** Add support for custom endpoints through environment variables or configuration options:

```go
baseURL := os.Getenv("GEMINI_BASE_URL")
options := []googleai.Option{googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey)}
if baseURL != "" {
    options = append(options, googleai.WithBaseURL(baseURL))
}
llm, err := googleai.New(context.Background(), options...)
```

### 7. ✅ Incomplete Documentation (FIXED)

**Issue:** While there are some comments, the documentation could be more comprehensive, especially for error scenarios and parameter expectations.

**Resolution:** The documentation has been expanded for all main functions, including purpose, parameters, and error scenarios:

```go
// NewGeminiClient creates a new instance of GeminiClient using langchaingo.
// It returns an error if the required GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.
//
// The Google API key is retrieved from the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.
// Ensure this variable is set before calling this function.
```

### 8. ❌ Hardcoded Temperature Scale (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Issue:** The temperature scale is hardcoded to 2.0, unlike other clients which may use different scaling factors.

**Recommendation:** Make the temperature scale configurable or consistent with other providers. Consider referencing a global constant for consistency.

### 9. ❌ Limited Interface Implementation (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Issue:** The client implements only the minimum required methods of the Client interface, potentially missing opportunities for Gemini-specific optimizations.

**Recommendation:** Consider extending the Client interface or adding Gemini-specific methods to leverage unique capabilities of the Gemini models.

### 10. ❌ Context Usage in Constructor (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Issue:** The constructor uses a background context for client creation, which doesn't allow for timeout or cancellation during initialization:

```go
llm, err := googleai.New(context.Background(), googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
```

**Recommendation:** Consider accepting a context parameter in the constructor to allow for timeout and cancellation:

```go
func NewGeminiClient(ctx context.Context) (*GeminiClient, error) {
    // ...
    llm, err := googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    // ...
}
```

## Implementation Summary

The updated implementation has significantly improved and addresses several of the critical issues identified in the review:

- **6 recommendations completely implemented/documented** (✅): Package documentation, error handling in QueryText, timeout handling documentation, model validation, API key validation, and function documentation.

- **4 recommendations not yet implemented** (❌): Custom endpoint support, configurable temperature scale, extended interface implementation, and context usage in constructor.

### Potential Next Steps

1. Add support for custom endpoints through environment variables
2. Make temperature scale configurable rather than hardcoded
3. Consider adding Gemini-specific methods to leverage unique capabilities 
4. Modify the constructor to accept a context parameter

Overall, the implementation is now more robust, with better error handling, validation, and documentation, but there are still opportunities for further improvements in flexibility and advanced features.
